Data sets
=========

A few data sets are and will be provided with karstnet.

For the moment, two karstic conduit networks are provided: Sakany and
Monachou. These datasets were kindly shared by Jean-Pierre Cassou under the
Creative Commons 0 license `CC0 <https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0>`_.

They can be used to test the various features of karstnet. In particular,
Sakany data are stored as ASCII files (nodes and links), while Monachou data
are provided in the GOCAD PLine ASCII format. The two data sets are
in the folder *data*.

The original data are also available on the `github pages of GHTopo
<https://github.com/JP-CASSOU/GHTopo>`_.
