Karstnet documentation
======================

Karstnet is a python 3 toolbox for the statistical analysis of karstic
networks. It considers a network of karstic conduits as a graph (an ensemble
of nodes and edges).

The package is a work in progress. The plan is to extend it to include
several features including plausibility test, additional input/output
interfaces, data base of network data, etc. Please contact us (see below)
if you need further information.
